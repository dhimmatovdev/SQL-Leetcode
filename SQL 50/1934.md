## **Intuition** 🤔  
Imagine you run a website where users sign up, and later, they either confirm their signup or just disappear. You want to know how "reliable" each user is—basically, what percentage of their actions are confirmations.  

For each user, we need to check:  
✅ How many times they confirmed their signup.  
❌ How many times they didn’t.  
Then, we calculate the **confirmation rate** as:  

\[
\frac{\text{Confirmed Actions}}{\text{Total Actions}}
\]  

If a user has no actions at all, their confirmation rate should be **0** (because they never confirmed).

## **Approach** 🚀  
1️⃣ **Start with all users**  
   - We take all users from the `Signups` table and make sure nobody is left out, even if they never confirmed anything.  
   - This is why we use a **LEFT JOIN** with the `Confirmations` table.  

2️⃣ **Convert actions into numbers**  
   - If a user **confirmed**, we count it as **1**.  
   - If they **didn’t confirm** (or if their action is something like "timeout"), we count it as **0**.  
   - We do this using a **CASE** statement inside `AVG()`.  

3️⃣ **Calculate the confirmation rate**  
   - The **AVG() function** works like magic here! Since we converted confirmations to `1`s and everything else to `0`s, averaging them gives us the fraction of confirmations.  
   - We round the result to **2 decimal places** for a cleaner output.  

4️⃣ **Group by user**  
   - Each user gets their own confirmation rate.

## **Complexity Analysis** 📊  

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - $$O(n)$$ (linear) because we scan the `Confirmations` table once, do a **JOIN**, and compute an average.  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - $$O(1)$$ since we’re not storing extra data, just calculating a number for each user.

## **Code** 💻  
```sql
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    ROUND(
        AVG(
            CASE
                WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1.00
                ELSE 0
            END
        ),
        2
    ) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
    Signups s
LEFT JOIN
    Confirmations c
    ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id;
```

## **Why This Works So Well** 🏆  
✅ **Handles missing data**: Users without actions still appear with a `0.00` rate.  
✅ **Scales efficiently**: Works even if we have millions of users.  
✅ **Simple & readable**: SQL does all the heavy lifting!  

So, in short—this query helps you **understand user behavior with minimal effort**. You now know how many of your users are actually following through with their signups. 🎯
